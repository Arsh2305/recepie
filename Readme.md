
1. Sort dried beans and discard any misshapen or discolored beans. Rinse a couple of times, and then soak 1 cup rajma (kidney beans) in enough water to cover them. Soaking should ideally last for 8 to 9 hours, so I usually soak them the night before I cook.

2. Once the beans are well soaked, discard the soaking water. Drain and rinse the soaked beans a few times to remove any leftover grit, if any.

3. Add the rinsed and drained kidney beans to a 3 litre pressure cooker.

4. Add 3.5 to 4 cups of water and stir. Pressure cook the rajma for 18 to 20 whistles (or for about 15 to 20 minutes). The cook time of your beans will vary depending on their quality and age.

5. While the kidney beans are cooking, chop 1 large onion (¾ to 1 cup finely chopped onion), 2 large tomatoes (1 cup finely chopped tomatoes) and make the crushed ginger+garlic+green chili paste.

For the paste, you need to crush or grind 1 inch ginger, 5 to 6 small garlic cloves (or 3 to 4 medium garlic cloves), and 1 to 2 green chilies to a paste in a mortar-pestle or a small grinder.

finally chopped tomatoes, onion and crushed ginger-garlic-green chillies kept aside for the rajma recipe
6. When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, open the lid. Check if the rajma is cooked or not by eating or pressing a bean with your fingers. The cooked beans should not have a bite to them and softened.

The rajma beans should be completely cooked. If they are not cooked completely, then pressure cook again (adding some water if required) for a few more minutes.

Making the masala
7. Heat either 3 tablespoons of butter (or 2 tablespoons butter + 1 tablespoon oil), in another pot or pan or kadai. Keep the heat to low or medium-low.

11. Keep on stirring the onions while sautéing them. This will ensure both uniform cooking and also that they don’t get burnt. Take care not to burn the onions, as this will impart bitter tones to the rajma curry.

12. Light browning of the onions is also fine.

19. Add all the spice powders one by one:

¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
½ teaspoon red chilli powder (or cayenne pepper or paprika)
1 teaspoon coriander powder
a pinch of asafoetida (hing)
½ teaspoon garam masala powder.
NOTE: If you are gluten free, be sure to source certified gluten free asafoetida, as many commercial brands process the spice with wheat.

21. Continue to sauté the whole masala base until the fat starts leaving the sides of the masala on a medium-low heat. The onion tomato masala will thicken, become glossy and start clumping around itself.

22. Use a slotted spoon or a strainer, remove the rajma beans from their cooking liquid and add them to the masala.


23. Stir and sauté for a minute.


24. Add 2 cups of the fresh water to the pan. If you like then you can also add the cooked rajma stock instead of fresh water.

25. Add salt as required.

26. Stir the whole rajma curry mixture.

27. On a low to medium-low heat, simmer without a lid for 10 to 12 minutes or more until the curry thickens slightly. The rajma curry should not be watery.

28. Mash a few rajma beans with the back of your spoon. This helps to thicken the rajma gravy.

29. Continue to simmer until you get a medium consistency in the curry.

30. Continue stirring at intervals when the rajma masala is simmering.

31. The Punjabi rajma masala has to thicken and the curry has to be of the right consistency, which is neither too thick nor thin.

34. Serve your completed rajma masala with steamed basmati rice, jeera rice, saffron rice, roti, paratha or naan. The combination of rajma and rice or rajma chawal is quite famous in North India.
